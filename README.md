# ISMIR 2020 Analysis

Included here are the analysis scripts, data, and related files for our ISMIR 2020 paper titled: "Butter Lyrics Over Hominy Grit": Comparing Audio and Psychology-Based Text Features in MIR Tasks. 

### Prerequisites

Analysis were run in R 3.6.2, using RStudio. 

In order to reduce issues related to package/dependency versions, we use renv. This installs a virtual environment based on the specific package versions used in this analysis. While it allows for the reduction of dependency issues, it also takes up hard disk space.Details can be found here:
https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html

We also include scripts for an additional variable selection procedure that we conducted, which was not included in the original paper. The running of this procedure requires the installation of a framework called JAGS, which is not available through CRAN. We used version 4.x. The installer can be downloaded from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/
